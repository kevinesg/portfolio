          Hi, I'm Kevin ðŸ‘‹. I'm a Data Engineer with 3.5 years of work
          experience in the data field.
        </p>
        <p>
          I prioritize setting up the foundation for our data architecture, then
          documenting the ETL/ELT data pipeline as well as the source of truth
          as we go and update our codebase. I like working with stakeholders
          directly to understand their needs and help them with their data
          requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          I prefer using open-source tools and frameworks, but I also have
          experience with cloud-based solutions like AWS and GCP. I tend to
          avoid low-code/ no-code solutions, as I believe they can lead to
          unnecessary complexity and vendor lock-in.
        </p>
        <p>
          While I don't plan to pursue a Web Developer role, I've recently
          started creating sites using React and TypeScript.
